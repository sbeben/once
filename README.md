## Once

A messenger where you are restricted to send one message a day to each contact.

### Why

- Anxiety and lack of concentration caused by  
  endless flow of information
- Constant need for "something new" in your device which is  
  a bad habit and a waste of time
- "Quality" of thoughts is replaced by quantity
- The limiteless ability to upload information into the web leads to  
  increasing of CO<sub>2</sub> emission and an increase in the land occupied by huge data centers
